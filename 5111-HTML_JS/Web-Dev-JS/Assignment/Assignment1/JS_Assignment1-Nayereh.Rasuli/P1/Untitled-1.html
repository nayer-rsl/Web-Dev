  <h1>About me!</h1>

    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>My name is Nayereh. I was born and raised in Tehran. I have a sister, and a brother. I am married, it has been four years now. I have studied Mechanical engineering, but I didn't like it much. I was not enjoying what I was doing as a mechanical engineer. It was rough, I wanted something more into design and art.</p>
  <h2>Solution</h2>
 
    <p>"What did you do then?"; you might ask!<br>Well, I started Portraite drawing, and I should admit, I was pretty good at it. But that didn't excite me either. It lacked thinking. Bored me after awhile . Didn't see value in it. The World dosn't stop without art, does it? Naaah.<br> Finally, I found Web development! And that was it. The key to my problems.</p>
