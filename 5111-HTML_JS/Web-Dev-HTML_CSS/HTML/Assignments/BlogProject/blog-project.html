        <h1>Getting started with Investing</h1>
        <div>September 27, 2021</div>
        <p>Your money losses value over time due to inflation. The average inflation rate is %2.5. In other words, if one cup of coffee is $1 today, It will be $1.25 next year. So putting your money in a savings account with a %0.25 interest rate might not be a good idea. One thing you can do instead to protect your hard-earned money is to invest it.</p>
        <p>But before jumping into investing, you should take care of 2 things first.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Debt</li>
            <li>Emergency fund</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Firstly, you should pay off your debt. The credit cards rate is around %20 annually. No investment will consistently return you this number. </p>

          <p>Secondly, You should set aside between three to six months of living expenses. In case something happens and you need cash right away.</p>

          <p>Once you ground off these two steps, it is time to know what type of investments you want to invest in.</p>
        <h2>Types of Investments</h2>
        <p>There are many types of investments. You can buy a property, or you can even buy a piece of art as an investment. In this article, we will cover the following six asset classes.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#stocks">Stocks</a></li>
          <li><a href="#bonds">Bonds</a></li>
          <li><a href="#etfs">ETFs</a></li>
          <li><a href="#mutual">Mutual funds</a></li>
          <li><a href="#reits">REITs</a></li>
          <li><a href="#commodities">Commodities</a></li>
        </ul>

          <h3 id="stocks">Stocks</h3>
          <p>A stock is a security that represents the ownership of a fraction of a corporation. The book value of a stock is the total assets of a company, subtracted by its liabilities, divided by its outstanding shares. The actual price, however, can be much higher than the book value, depending on the sector, demand, the expected future growth and much more. Picking an individual stock needs fundamental analysis.</p>
          <h3 id="bonds">Bonds</h3>
          <p>A bond is a loan from an investor to a borrower such as a company or government. The borrower uses the money to fund its operations, and the investor receives interest on the investment. The risk and reward of the Bonds are low, which makes them suitable for seniors or short-term investment.</p>
          <h3 id="etfs">ETFs</h3>
          <p>An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a type of security that tracks an index, sector, commodity, or other assets. ETFs can contain many types of investments, including stocks, commodities, bonds, or a mixture of investment types. Fractions of 10000 stocks can form an ETF and can be traded like a stock. ETFs are not volatile and are the best option for beginners.</p>
          <h3 id="mutual">Mutual funds</h3>
          <p>A mutual fund is a pool of money collected from many investors to invest in securities like stocks, bonds, and other assets by fund management. They are operated by professionals who allocate the fund's assets and attempt to produce capital gains or income for the fund's investors. Mutual funds are the best options for passive investors</p>
          <h3 id="reits">REITs</h3>
          <p>Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) is a company that owns, operates or finances income-producing real estate across a range of property sectors. These companies should oblige with a specific set of governmental regulations. For instance, these companies have to pay at least 90% of their taxable income as shareholder dividends each year, making them a good pick for income investors.</p>
          <h3 id="commodities">Commodities</h3>
          <p>A commodity is a basic good. It is a raw material or agricultural product that can be traded. Examples of commodities you can invest in are grains, gold, gas, or even coffee.</p>

          <p>There are lots of other investments you can choose from too. But keep in mind, it is best to make a diversified portfolio by mixing a wide variety of investments. You can get more information on diversified portfolios <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversification_(finance)">here</a>. This way, your portfolio will yield higher long-term returns by lowering the risk of any individual holding or security and benefiting from snow-balling.</p>
